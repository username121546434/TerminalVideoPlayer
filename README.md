# Download

Go to the github release page to download this

# Usage

After downloading, you can simply double click the exe or type it into your terminal, then you enter the filepath to your video.

# Building and contributing

On Windows, you can just open the `TerminalVideoPlayer.sln` file in Visual Studio and it should just work.
On other platforms, you will need to get the Opencv and {fmt} C++ libraries, which are both cross platform.
However, I have not tested this on other platforms, so I cannot be sure if it works on them.
